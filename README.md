Set of scripts to cange colorsheme based on background image

I made a quick python script to genreate colorshemes based on images, it searches for colors used in the image that are similar a predifined default set.

autorice.sh 
is a shell script that reads in the colorscheme and applies it to i3wm, i3bar, rofi, and xfce4-term. It could be modified pretty easily to work with other wms/applications
